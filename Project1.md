I chose Liberia as my country to analayze. Liberia's population isn't too big or too small compared to the rest of the countries in the world. Based on the picture most of Liberia's population lies in the northern part of the state with the most populated county in Liberia being Monterrado. The most populated city in Liberia is Greater Monrovia as noted by the abdm2 barplot.

The population density was again shows that most of Liberia's population lies in the northern part of the state. Although most of the population lies in the norhtern part of Liberia, the southern part of Liberia contains most of its urban areas. Lastly, the graph shows that there are more people who live in urban areas in the south than in the north.

## Transportation network

The graph shows that the urban areas in the southern part of Liberia have little to no roads to travel to the hospitals and clinics in the north. The only roads that are availabe in the south are the primary roads. The north has limited primary roads, though they have access to secondary and tershiary roads. This means that access to health care is easily facilitated in the north, but not in the south.
