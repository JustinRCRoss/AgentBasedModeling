## Dynamic Stimulation Models

<p>The data science method that will be explored is dynamic stimulation modeling. Dynamic stimulation models are virtual representation of the real world where individuals and communities at and react, develop health conditions, and use health services in the same way as people do in real life (preventencentre.org). Dynamic stimulation models bring together a variety of evidence sources such as research, expert knowledge, practice experience, and data to create its model that represents the world (cjni.net). Using computers Dynamic stimulation models allows us to create stimulations that would be impossible in the real world due to the cost (cjni.net). Dynamic stimulation models can be used to represent complex human behaviors, follow individuals throughout life, identify how people’s influences and behavior change and show how their health is impacted over time (preventencentre.org). Dynamic stimulation models also have other uses. They can be used to map the aggregate effect of thousands of people operating in a complex system, following their interactions and responses to different policies and interventions (preventioncentre.org). The Dynamic Stimulation models is best used as a what if tool. The model can be used to test various policy scenarios over time to see which are likely have the most effect, both on individuals as well as on the system (precentioncentre.org).</p>

As state above there are many uses for the dynamic stimulation models, however there is a problem of whether the models are valid. The dynamic stimulation model’s validity depends on the purpose for which the model is developed (ocw.mit.edu). An example of a model that would be less valid would be a model that tried to explicitly model each household (ocw.mit.edu). This model would be tough to make as it would be hard to collect data for each household in an area. What this means is that the validity of the model relies on the user (ocw.mit.edu). If a model can be used with confidence than the model is most likely a valid model (ocw.mit.edu). A model that has confidence is a model that has several of the following conditions. A model must focus on the boundaries at which it is working on. This means that a model working at the state level should not gain national data. A model should have test for extreme conditions and have behavior that is replicable but not anomalous (ocw.mit.edu). Lastly, dynamic stimulation models should be way of previous existing systems when used to predict how a system would behave (ocw.mit.edu).The dynamic stimulation models must pass many tests before it can be used effectively, through once it has passed this test one can be confident that an accurate stimulation of a policy can be implemented. This allows users of the dynamic stimulation models to provide a confidence for their models through rigorous tests that insure the validity of the model.
