## Use of Machine Learning Methods in Agent-Based Modeling

The method I am going to discuss is the use of machine and deep learning in agent-based models.  Machine learning is a branch of AI that focuses on building applications that can learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being programmed to do so (ibm.com). In machine learning, algorithms are ‘trained’ to find patterns and features in massive amounts of data in order to make decisions and predictions based on new data (ibm.com). On the other hand, deep learning is a subset of machine learning (ibm.com). Deep learning algorithms define an artificial network that is designed to learn the way the human brain learns (ibm.com).


Agent-Based Models are becoming a powerful new paradigm for describing complex socio-economic systems; however, these models can be improved by using machine learning methods (iastate.edu). Applying these machine learning methods take a few steps. First, we must construct an ABM and generate a synthetic time series data (iastate.edu). Then, a multi-layered, deep neural network is designed and trained on the synthetic data (iastate.edu). Third, the trained neural networks would be empirically validated using real-world data (iastate.edu). Lastly, we apply the trained empirically validated deep neural network to economic policy analysis (iastate.edu). All of these steps are important because we can use this trained neural network to help our analysis of our agent-based model. For example, the neural network can be trained to predict the actions of a particular agent in the model (iastate.edu). Another example would be that a neural network can be trained to predict the probabilistic structure on the macro-level, of variables in the ABM model, based on the initialization parameters (iastate.edu). One difficulty in using a neural is that the design of a neural network can be a complicated problem (iastate.edu). This isn’t a massive problem because there are methods to reduce the complexity of a neural network.


The previous example talked about using agent-based models in an economic perspective, this next example is using agent-based models to observe behaviors. In agent-based models a wide range of behaviors and outcomes can be observed (northwestern.edu). In many, cases these behaviors can be categorized into discrete outcomes (northwestern.edu. Machine learning can help make the task of investigation this type of agent-based models easier (northwestern.edu. Machine learning has clustering algorithms which allows computer to determine which set of clusters belong to a certain group. This is helpful because we can send our observed data points that contain our population and behavior that we are observing to the computer. The computer will then be able to separate it into two clusters. The use of clustering algorithm greatly reduces the time it takes for people to analyze their agent-based models. Lastly, one other use of machine learning in agent-based modeling is that we can build agent-based models using machine learning methods (geosimulation.org).
