## Provide a written description of the analysis you conducted of the gravity model for London. Additionally, incorporate the Garcia et al. paper into your description while introducing your the migration data for your selected country. Supplement your introduction with spatial plots that describe in/out migration by adminsitrative subdivision.

## Produce an origin-destination matrix and include a portion of it as an exhibit in your write-up. Be sure to identify the number of rows in your data frame while also including the following. 

## Describe your OD matrix and how it is used to model migration across the administrative subdivisions that comprise your selected location.

## Produce an animation of migration and elaborate on how your OD matrix and gravity model could be integrated with your simulation

## At the level of your selected, higher resolution administrative subdivision (where you produced defacto descriptions of settlements), use the center points of each settlement to produce a tesselation of voronoi polygons. Similar to your analysis of the higher level administrative subdivisions, address the following
